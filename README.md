# Digital Habit Tracker
Working with Data and Code; A2 Code Prototype Project 
> This project is a monthly habit tracking prototype designed specfically for ADHD and neurodivergent children and young adolescents. The interface uses pastel colour coding UI, low-clutter spacing & font design, large hit targets, and simplified navigation to reduce cognitive load and support routine building. This prototype also transforms each month’s habit data into generative visualisation. Each habit becomes a coloured radial “growth ring”; the amount of completed days determines how far that arc grows. Built in Processing (Python Mode) to demonstrate code literacy, interaction design, and how generative visuals can positively reinforce routine-building.

## General Information
- Description: This is a Provide general information about your project here. Each ring = a habit, arc length = % completed. Data is saved per-month (CSV/TXT) so each month starts clean while preserving history.- What problem does it (intend to) solve?
- What is the purpose of your project? This intentional visual feedback loop is grounded in research on motivation, dopamine reinforcement and behaviour scaffolding — turning habit tracking into something playful, encouraging and meaningful to the user.- Why did you undertake it?
