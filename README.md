# Digital Habit Tracker
Working with Data and Code; A2 Code Prototype Project 
> This project is a monthly habit tracking prototype designed specfically for ADHD and neurodivergent children and young adolescents. The interface design intentionally uses pastel colour-banding, large hit-targets, clean spacing, and minimal cognitive load UI principles. Each month’s tracked habits are then transformed into generative visualisation; each habit becomes a coloured “growth ring arc” that expands based on how many days were completed. This prototype also transforms each month’s habit data into generative visualisation. This prototype explores how visualisation through code can actively support positive behaviour change.

## What Problem Does it Solve?
- Most habit trackers are either overcrowded, subscription-blocked, or visually hard to decode; particularly for ADHD processing. This tool turns daily routine into visual feedback reinforcement rather than just statistics or numbers. The aim is to make behaviour tracking engaging, encouraging, playful and meaningful rather than clinical.

## Why I Undertook This
- This project was motivated through lived experience; both myself and my younger brother are ADHD, and rely strongly on visual routine scaffolds. Research shows ADHD cognition responds best to growth metaphors, simple symbolic shaping, consistent visual rhythm & reward-based reinforcement loops. This prototype is a digital translation of that principle.


## Technologies Used
- Processing (Python Mode)
- Built-in Processing UI/graphics/colour functions
- CSC/TXT data save + load (per month history)


## Features
- Add / remove custom habits at any time
- Tick daily completions in monthly, calender-like view
- Automatic progress tracking & progress bar
- Monthly motivational quote card
- End-of-month “reward working toward” editable area
- Switch between months & preserve habit history
- Export generative radial habit visualisation as PNG

## Setup
Processing → Install Python Mode → open sketch folder → run.
No external libraries required for this prototype. Simple, efficient, effective.


## Usage
1. Open Processing → Python Mode
2. Run sketch
3. Tick habits daily
4. Switch months using arrows
5. Open “Visualisation” tab → export PNG
Tracked data saves automatically monthly as .csv and .txt.

## Inspiration
- Inspired by personal habit tracking physical journals
